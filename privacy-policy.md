  Welcome to Pilot for Reddit ("we," "us," or "our"). Our mission is to be your copilot across the Reddit universe, starting
  by helping you craft the perfect reply and engage in conversations in any language.

  This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our browser
  extension, Pilot for Reddit (the "Service"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms
  of this privacy policy, please do not access or use the Service.

  1. Information We Collect

  We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the Service includes:

  a) Account Information
  When you register an account with us through Google OAuth, we collect personal information necessary for account
  management, such as:
   * Your name
   * Your email address
   * Your Google profile picture

  This information is used to identify you, secure your account, and manage your subscription status.

  b) Content for AI Processing
  To provide our core AI-powered features, we process content that you provide:
   * Reddit Content: When you use features like "AI Reply," we process the content of the specific Reddit post or comment you
     wish to reply to.
   * User Instructions: We process the text you voluntarily type into the instruction box to guide the AI's response (e.g., a
     viewpoint to expand upon or a draft to revise).

  Important: We are committed to your privacy. The Reddit content and user instructions sent for AI analysis are processed in
  real-time. We do not store this content on our servers after the request is completed. The data is used ephemerally to
  generate a response and then immediately discarded.

  c) Anonymous Usage Data
  We may collect anonymous, aggregated data regarding your activity on the Service, such as which AI modes (e.g., "Humorous,"
  "In-depth Analysis") are used most frequently. This data is not personally identifiable and is used solely for the purpose
  of improving the Service and user experience.

  2. How We Use Your Information

  Having accurate information about you permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience.
  Specifically, we may use information collected about you via the Service to:

   * Create and manage your account.
   * Provide the core AI-powered comment generation services.
   * Monitor and analyze usage and trends to improve your experience with the Service.
   * Display your daily usage quota and subscription status within the extension.
   * Respond to your customer service requests.

  3. Data Storage and Security

  We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information.

   * Account Information: Your account information (name, email, subscription status) is stored securely on our servers.
   * Content for AI Processing: As stated above, this content is not stored.
   * Data Transmission: All communication between the extension and our backend services, including with our AI service
     providers, is encrypted using industry-standard protocols.

  While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our
  efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any
  interception or other type of misuse.

  4. Disclosure of Your Information

     we may share your information as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation.
   * Third-Party Service Providers: We may share your information with third parties that perform services for us or on our
     behalf, including AI processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, and customer service. These third
     parties are contractually obligated to keep your information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we
     disclose it to them.
